In the past it was carved into the wall of caves, or made into dolls using raw materials found in nature. Human kind have always know a fascination, if not a need, in producing other beings in our likeness, mush like the creation stories of how God fashioned us in ¡°his/her¡± own image. These toys evolved into a fine craft with time, and were given to us as children. As our playthings and friends, they became an integral part of our imaginations and psyches. They served as markers and witnesses in our personal histories, appearing as characters in our stories, and as such, began a life of their own, out of the hands of their creators, in a world of their own.</p>  <p>Toy culture and these iconic images and characters; have grown in our time to be a huge phenomenon. It crosses the boundaries of fine art, high and low culture, the sweet and sometimes dark aspects ourselves. The Japanese were at the forefront with their cutting edge productions of Anime and Manga, prompting an Otaku cult which today has spread all over the world. US animation productions, from Mickey Mouse to the Simpsons have become household names and larger than life characters in our daily lives. </p>  <p>We are lucky to have now, characters, icons, toys to love well into adult hood. From the whimsical to adorable, erotic to innocent to the dark and gothic, luring us into their lush worlds, of fairy tales, dreams and inspirations, where id driven impulses and alter egos come to life. We invite you to slip into this mysterious parallel world of the imagination with us in the Garden of Eye Candy.</p>  <div> <p><b>Price: £¤ 270 RMB</b><br> <span class="chushou"><b>(Only for Chinese market)</b></span></p></div><div><p><a href="index.html" class="one">home</a><br><a  href="bookshop.html" class="one">back</a></p></div></div><div id="tu01"><p><img src="images/pageone/The%20Garden%20of%20Eye%20Candy/The-Garden-of-Eye-Candy.jpg" width="200" height="283"></p></div><div id="tu02"><p><img src="images/pageone/The%20Garden%20of%20Eye%20Candy/The-Garden-of-Eye-Candy01.jpg" width="187" height="283"></p></div><div id="tu03"><p><img src="images/pageone/The%20Garden%20of%20Eye%20Candy/The-Garden-of-Eye-Candy02.jpg" width="194" height="283"></p></div><div id="tu04"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu05"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu06"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu07"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu08"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu09"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu10"><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div id="tu11"><p>&nbsp;</p></div></body></html>

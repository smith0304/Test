The Museo Bodoniano Foundation celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Manuale Tipografico by Cavalier Giambattista Bodoni, printed in Parma in 1818, with an exhibition and study day. <br>The events took place in Parma in March and April 2019, in the beautiful rooms of the Palatina Library at the Museo Bodoniano. Italian and international designers and researches were invited to participate. The exhibition presented original manuscripts and typographical handbooks from the XVIIth, XVIIIth, XIXth and XXth century alongside posters designed for the exhibition by contemporary international designers. Using Bodoniâ€™s Manuale and other manuscripts as a starting point, the aim was to reflect on the role of typography as a source and mirror of its cultural and historical context.",

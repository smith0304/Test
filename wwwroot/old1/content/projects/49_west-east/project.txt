At first I thought they were two different people, but later found out they are one. I received an invitation from Alexander Vasin to participate in the creation of Typomania on the theme of West and East and to give a speech. My work and living experience came to me when I saw the theme, in which the West and the East have never been apart, like the letter W is close to E in WE. So I came to Moscow with great curiosity for Typomania. In the Museum of Moscow I was thrilled by the display of all these black and white posters and young designers. Thrilled, but also determined, I re-discovered my passion as a designer again. I also understood what Typomania means. It stands for wildness, enthusiasm, youth, passion, diligence and motivation.\"<br>This poster won the Silver Prize at the 12th International Poster Triennial Toyama in Japan (2018).<br>",

        "content": "Exhibition catalogue for Pictography — Chinese Poster and Book Design Today<br>Schriftbilder Bilderschrift — Chinesisches Plakat- und Buchdesign heute — Contemporary Chinese graphic design exhibition in Germany, co-curated by He Jumping and René Grohnert, presented at Muesum Folkwang, Essen, Germany, in June 2016. The exhibition featured book and poster designs by more than 70 designers from <br>Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Designed for the exhibition, Schriftbilder Bilderschrift — Chinesisches Plakat- und Buchdesign heute is a catalogue that differs from the conventionally rectangular, symmetrical and flat book design. Istead, it has a trapezoid shape and is filled with folded pages in the <br>style of traditional Chinese books. <br>The design seeks to explore the possibilities of forms in traditional Chinese book design by adopting a trapezoidal shape with unequal height. Unlike the general arrangement of bilingual books, Schriftbilder Bilderschrift — Chinesisches Plakat- und Buchdesign heute ingeniously conceals the Chinese parts and other sections into the folding pages. <br>Printed in special colors and mostly hand-made, the book not only shows the maturity of contemporary Chinese book design and printing techniques; it is also intended to remind the modern audience, in the era of e-books, of the significance <br>of hand-made books that serve not only functional purposes, but also retain an aesthetic and collecting value as art.",

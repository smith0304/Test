        "content": "\"In 1996, I left China for an unfamiliar city, Berlin, on my own. I remember the past 12 years, which include a shift from studying and working at university to establishing my own studio. My life felt difficult and arduous and it seemed to me that I had taken a detour in my journey. I thought that if I had avoided the circuitous route in my life, I could cast aside all my struggles, anxiety, pain and conflicting feelings. I almost forgot how to appreciate the scenery on my life journey. In 2008, Innocentre Hong Kong and Hong Kong Polytechnic University invited me to present a solo exhibition in Hong Kong. As I fretted over packing the works, I thought about my long journey from China to Europe. <br>Now, the trip seemed reversed as my works were taking the long journey back to Asia. This exhibition was also part of my circuitous life, hence the title detour.\"",

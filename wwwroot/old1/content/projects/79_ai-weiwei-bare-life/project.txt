The book includes a new essay on human rights by Ai Weiwei and an interview in which he discusses his artwork and activism. It also features installation photographs of the corresponding exhibition. By exploring Ai Weiwei’s artistic practice in dialogue with philosophies, theories and concepts that connect human life and political power, this publication offers new insights into one of the most important artists working today.<br>",

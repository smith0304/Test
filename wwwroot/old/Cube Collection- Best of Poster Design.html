Posters also play an important part during elections and political campaigns. Besides, posters can be used (and are frequently used) solely for decorative purposes. Whatever function they serve, they are meant to be displayed and seen. </p>  <p>Throughout the past, the role and appearance of the poster has changed continuously. Since the first poster exhibition 1884 in France and the technological advance of the printing industry in the second half of the 19th century, the medium poster has conquered the public space and has become an essential device for mass communication.

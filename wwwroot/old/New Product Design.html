Is it old phrase "form follows function" (Louis Sullivan) still valid today?<br>Judge for yourself-by browsing the following pages. There you'll find both new inventions and new designs for old inventions. Once again, Zeixs-the collaboration between the Berlin-based publishing house Feierabend unique Books and the design agency 12ender-has asked designers from all around the globe to submit their newest designs and prototypes. Some are aesthetic variations of already established models. Some are entirely new inventions. Sometimes it's difficult to tell whether the design-idea or the idea for a new item came first. After all, everything-every tool, gadget, item-has to be designed in one way or another. Therefore, this book collects both fresh designs for old things and things which ate new in respect to their design and function. More importantly, "New Product Design" is -like the entire Zeixs-project in general-open for everyone. Anyone can participate, regardless if someone's a professional or an amateur.The collection includes useful things and inventive designs as well as some humorous stuff. Some designs are clearly indebted to the still ongoing revival of classic and futuristic sixties design, some seem to refer to the eighties, while others point to the future. But despite these elements and quotations they're all firmly rooted in the here and now. That's what makes New Product Design relevant-it showcases the wide range of current product design. You probably won¡¯t find any of this at your local IKEA store. But then again- who knows ¡­.</p>  <div> <p><b>Price: £¤ 190 RMB</b><br> <span class="chushou"><b>(Only for Chinese market)</b></span></p></div><div><p><a  href="index.html" class="one">home</a><br><a  href="bookshop.html" class="one">back</a></p></div></div><div id="tu01"><p><img src="images/pageone/New%20Product%20Design/New-Product-Design01.jpg" width="200" height="200"></p></div><div id="tu02"><p></p></div><div id="tu03"><p></p></div><div id="tu04"><p></p></div><div id="tu05"><p></p></div><div id="tu06"><p></p></div></body></html>

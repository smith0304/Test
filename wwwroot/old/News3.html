The poster is having a new renaissance in China. Emerged has a generation of graphic designers that sees international poster art with a fresh and unspoiled eye, using these influcences for an own visual language, without plagiarizing or negating the own tradition.<br>        </p>		  <p class="style3">A wide range of individual expressions marks the current Chinese poster. All means of visual design are being used ¨C from free drawing to digitally altered photography. It seems that the young Chinese graphic design scene has emphatically reintroduced the emblematic as an essential aspect of the poster, into public awareness. The Chinese tradition of scripture, which is especially obligated to the emblematic, might be a root of that. </p>		  <p class="style3">In his works, Jiangping He manages to establish a bridge between Europe and Asia. The graphic artist studied Visual Communication at the Chinese Academy of Arts in Hangzhou, continuing his studies at the Academy of Arts in Berlin (from 1997-2001), where he became a pupil of Prof. Hans-J¨¹rgen Kristhan. Today, he is an artistic assistant at this academy.<br>  Dividing his time between China and Germany, he has rendered outstanding services to making international graphic design popular in China. With ¡°Life + Design¡± and ¡°Master &amp; Students,¡± he has designed and published a series of books which introduce their readers to the lives, views, and works of artists he admires as role models. The care and the artistic noblesse of the book¡¯s designs do not only give a hint at the level of respect with which Jianping He sees his subjects. These features also show much of his talent as a designer of books, his subtle handling of image and scripture, his feeling for the material.</p>		  <p class="style3">The posters of Jiangping He surprise with their subjects that on the one hand seem familiar, on the other hand are defamiliarized at the same time. He likes using the human head as a significant image, employing one of the most popular and also most variable motives of the 20th century poster. The human head is always the mirror of our identity, too. This explains the big suggestive force that each of these motives has. Identification or distance are established at once.<br>  We perceive each and every alteration of the face or the head as an attack on ourselves, which immediately alerts our attention. In his posters for the Eurasia Language Institute, Jianping He writes with colorful letters over faces, to evoke connotations of language- and thought-confusions and the possibilities of their resolution. The faces and heads are anonymous and individual at the same time. They are eye-catching, but not because of extravaganza;they appear as ordinary as you and me.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">The poster for Amnesty International, made in the year 2000, shows a face resembling Holy Sebastian, tortured with needles, emerging from darkness. Pain, but also resistance are expressed and merge into a motive of accusation. Similarly, in his poster for the Human Rights Day from the same year, the grapic artist uses an arm with a fist, violated by needles, as a gesture of accusation and protest.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">In ¡°Water is Life,¡± the close-up of a face shows huge cracks, dried-up paths, resembling a torn soil. We ourselves are nature. Jianping He always looks for the immediate connection. There are no locations outside of our being. We are always affected. The clarity of this stance is also being expressed by the reflection of current political discourse. The swastika as a brand on the back of a head is a lapidary answer to the questionable Leitkultur (lead culture) debate in Germany and its historic dimension. Deeply rooted views and their current presence manifest themselves in this stigma, the symbol of the suffering of millions. Without explicit derivation, Jianping He employs the obvious play of words Leit - Leid (lead - suffering), which was picked up by a number of graphic artists and carricaturists at the time. With a striking simplicity and conciseness, he used this as a visual commentary. Image and text complement each other. In ¡°Chinese Artists¡± (2001), the red star is an expression of heritage, and at the same time a trademark.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">In his poster for the exhibition ¡°Chinese Fashion Culture¡± from 1999, Jianping He uses the silhouette of a Mao portrait to remind the viewer of how Chinese culture was once dominated by Mao Tse Tungs totalitarian powers. He excludes Mao¡¯s face and uses only the well-known silhouette, which has long become a topos in media ¨C in large part due to Andy Warhol¡¯s portrait series from 1972. In times of cold war, Warhol stilized the face of the political enemy of the Western world into a pop icon, evoking public provocation. With his poster, Jianping He reflected on a past from which people in China had departed only recently. The memories were still too fresh not to be perceived as a provocation. The display of the poster was forbidden.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">Jianping He consciously uses the medium of the poster to put his own reflections about society to open discussion. For him, it does not suffice to convey objective information. On the contrary, he uses an associative visual language which, surpassing matter-of-fact information, allows a second level of personal commentary. His pointed design and significant forms convey purpose with its visual interpretation, without a superficial attitude. Jianping He mainly works with photography and defamiliarizing techniques. He follows a poster tradition which started in Germany with outstanding artists like Holger Matthies, Gunter Rambow and Frieder Grindler. Frequently, an axial framing dominates the design, such as in ¡°German-Chinese Discussion Forum¡± from 2001 and 2002, or in the posters ¡°Transformierte Wirklichkeiten¡± (transformed realities) from 2003. In his works that adress the issue of cloning, he has used the mirror principle. Here, the vertical is stressed.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">His text posters are different. Jianping He likes to put scripture into an imaginary space or into landscapes that imply infinity. In general, the graphic artist uses color only very focused and sparingly. In his text posters, he does not use color at all. Here, he follows the tradition of Chinese ink drawings, working with the contrasts of black and white. Digital imagery has replaced hand-drawn concepts, though. Black scripture often stands in front of wide landscapes, melting with them, eventually becoming a part of the landscapes. It takes on natural forms, resembling twigs or branches. In China, writing and drawing was at one time considered to be one and the same form of art.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">Jianping He, too, composes the forms of scripture with the same demand he has towards the design of motives. Comparable to ink drawing, landscapes are shown as a poetic space. Jianping He shows the intrinsics of nature. The singular form has no meaning in it. Sometimes, the foggy landscapes appear surreal. Latin letters stand in them like monuments and lead into and endless depths. Contrary to Chinese letters, they are not part of the landscape, but are advertising signs, heavily exposed. These posters are house advertising: ¡°Come back to Asia.¡± The title is more than an announcement of an exhibition.<br>          </p>		  <p class="style3">Jianping He likes to work with fuzziness. The method is known from Uwe Loesch, but Jianping He¡¯s use of that technique remings of the brush strokes in Chinese paintings. The graphic artist uses this in his very own way. Scripture appears as a projection into a white space, diagonally growing, moving around an imaginary globe (Eurasian Language Institute). Jianping He works with extreme polarisation of black and white. He does not use clear contours. Instead, black crystallizes bit by bit out of soft rims of a grey halation, which gives the black color an intensive, velvet glow in the athmospheric white. As a long shadow, scripture looks like a movement that has frozen into a letter, in the infinite space of white paper, and at the same time an echoing sound in a musical space.</p>	    <p class="style3">The musicality and the simultaneously poetic dimension may be the most important features that distinguish these posters, giving them something unique.</p></td>		<td width="111" height="3180" rowspan="8">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="186" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<a href="index.html"				onmouseover="changeImages('News3_10', 'images/News3_10-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseout="changeImages('News3_10', 'images/News3_10.gif'); return true;"				onmousedown="changeImages('News3_10', 'images/News3_10-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseup="changeImages('News3_10', 'images/News3_10-Over.gif'); return true;">				<img name="News3_10" src="images/News3_10.gif" width="39" height="13" border="0" alt=""></a></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="13" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<a href="Profile.html"				onmouseover="changeImages('News3_11', 'images/News3_11-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseout="changeImages('News3_11', 'images/News3_11.gif'); return true;"				onmousedown="changeImages('News3_11', 'images/News3_11-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseup="changeImages('News3_11', 'images/News3_11-Over.gif'); return true;">				<img name="News3_11" src="images/News3_11.gif" width="39" height="15" border="0" alt=""></a></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="15" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="39" height="2966" rowspan="5">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="1890" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td height="17" colspan="4">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="17" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td height="19" colspan="3" bgcolor="#000000"><span class="style6">Dr. Anita K¨¹hnel, Curator and Director of Art Library Berlin </span></td>		<td width="292" height="1059" rowspan="3">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="19" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="187" height="19" valign="top" bgcolor="#000000"><span class="style6">Berlin, April 2005 </span></td>		<td colspan="2" rowspan="2">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="19" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="187" height="1021">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="1021" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="33" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="39" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="37" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="164" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td width="350">			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="350" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td width="81">			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="61" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="292" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="111" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td></td>	</tr></table><!-- End ImageReady Slices --></body></html>

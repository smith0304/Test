Jianping struck me as very interesting without having a brash personality, and since then our paths have crossed on numerous occasions. Jianping He has found a route into European design culture in a way few other Asian designers have. He is equally at home playing around with the idioms and characteristics of European design as he is with those of Chinese design, which forges a design dialogue between the two, so to speak. This is not merely due to Jianping He having studied both in Germany and China, but rather in his open-minded interest in the manifold facets of design, which has seen him travel across the globe, and his constantly seeking dialogue and debate with his contemporaries.		  </span>		  <p class="style2">Jianping He¡¯s interest in the work of his professional contemporaries is well known. For many of them ¨C I am fortunate to count myself amongst these lucky individuals ¨C he has publicized monographs, and in his major work ¡°All Men Are Brothers¡± he questioned them intimately on their personal development and professional philosophy.</p>		  <p class="style2">His publications manage on the one hand to give China an understanding of Western design, and on the other to bring the West closer to the culture of Asian design. We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude for this undertaking of his.</p>		  <p class="style2">However, Jianping He is also a talented designer; astounding us time and again with new solutions, which usually display a combination of photography and typography. His works seem effortlessly captivating; containing a hint of Asia and yet managing to have a distinct European conceptual feel. Jianping He¡¯s works radiate an air of poetry and often conceal, while still having a clear message, a hidden secret. One can see from Jianping¡¯s work that he is a designer who lives his profession.</p>		  <p class="style2">Jianping He¡¯s professional development has been vast and I remain as curious as ever to see which spheres he will delve into next.</p>	    <p class="style2">And for this we should all be happy!</p></td>		<td width="139" height="3195" rowspan="6">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="201" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<a href="index.html"				onmouseover="changeImages('News_10', 'images/News_10-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseout="changeImages('News_10', 'images/News_10.gif'); return true;"				onmousedown="changeImages('News_10', 'images/News_10-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseup="changeImages('News_10', 'images/News_10-Over.gif'); return true;">				<img name="News_10" src="images/News_10.gif" width="39" height="13" border="0" alt=""></a></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="13" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<a href="Profile.html"				onmouseover="changeImages('News_11', 'images/News_11-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseout="changeImages('News_11', 'images/News_11.gif'); return true;"				onmousedown="changeImages('News_11', 'images/News_11-Over.gif'); return true;"				onmouseup="changeImages('News_11', 'images/News_11-Over.gif'); return true;">				<img name="News_11" src="images/News_11.gif" width="39" height="15" border="0" alt=""></a></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="15" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="39" height="2966" rowspan="3">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="376" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="354" height="25" valign="middle" bgcolor="#000000"><span class="style4">Niklaus Troxler, Switzerland, 2007 </span></td>		<td height="2590" colspan="2" rowspan="2">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="25" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td width="354" height="2565">&nbsp;			</td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="2565" alt=""></td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="33" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="39" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="38" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="354" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="390" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="94" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td>			<img src="images/spacer.gif" width="139" height="1" alt=""></td>		<td></td>	</tr></table><!-- End ImageReady Slices --></body></html>
